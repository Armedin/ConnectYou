# ConnectYou
Meet and chat to students who are at your university and share your interests.

Following up what Phil wrote on the instructions about how to start the website:


Go to the browser and navigate to localhost/phpmyadmin/
You will notice some tabs such as "Databases", "SQL", "Status" etc.
On that you will notice a tab called "Import". 
Open that tab and it will say "Importing into the current server".
Click choose file and go to the project folder at include/db/connectyou.sql
Once you have chosen the file, at the end of the page, click the "Go" button
Now the database is set up.
